This quickly went awry. The Russian army bogged down in the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital and had to withdraw. In the east it penetrated along a broad front, but not deeply.

About the show:

Over the past few years, the issue of refugees has become highly politicised. Refugees are seen either as victims or aggressors to be kept out. Yet there are groups of refugees who have trumped the odds. In this series, we feature an earlier wave of refugees who haven’t just survived, but are thriving today and giving back to their communities. Our culinary heroes originated from every part of Asia and fanned out across the globe in search of new lives. Today, they are using food in powerful ways and reshaping the way people see Asia. Behind each dish is a story of survival - stories of refugees who seek freedom from societies in conflict, of people who struggle to build new lives with treasured family recipes, and cities that have been enriched by their presence.

It is situated on Syangboche in the Kumbu region of Nepal, within the Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park – a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

“The hotel offers 360-degree views of the Himalayas mountain range that includes Mount Everest at 8,848m above sea level.

The trishaw evolved from the rickshaw – a small, two-wheeled cart pulled by a man. 

Originating from Japan, rickshaws were first seen in Singapore in the 1880s. They were one of the earliest modes of transport in Singapore, alongside steam trams and bullock carts.

Rickshaw rides were inexpensive and ideal for short journeys through crowded inner-city streets.

The first trishaws were officially registered in Singapore in 1914, according to Roots, a website by the National Heritage Board (NHB). Known as “pedal rickshaws”, these early trishaws were essentially modified rickshaws attached to bicycles.

The longest R&D we did was for Miebianbian bakmie noodles. It took four months. Our Miebianbian bakmie noodle recipe originated from Medan. After we did R&D for the first month, I almost gave up. It was very tedious. We ate and threw away a lot of bakmie noodles. I never ate so many noodles all my life. There is also no bakmie noodles supplier in Singapore. Most are made in-house or they use mee kia as a replacement instead. I made my foodie friends come by for many rounds of food tasting. I soon realised that when I wouldn’t hear back from them, I failed.  They just couldn’t bear to tell me. We revised the recipe at least eight times until one day, my foodie friends couldn’t stop calling me to ask me to release the bakmie noodles so they could order them. Only then, I knew we had succeeded. The R&D ended there. During the process, we broke a 30-litre commercial dough mixer within four months and I gained a few kilos.

Betta fish originated from Thailand but can be found in nearby countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Wild bettas live in shallow, freshwater areas such as rice paddies, stagnant ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Being used to Asian climates, they prefer warm water around 80º Fahrenheit. Colder water can cause them to become lethargic, stop eating, or become more prone to disease or infection. Their diet mainly consists of plankton, crustaceans, and larvae.

Because their usual habitats are extremely low in oxygen, bettas have evolved to breathe air at the water’s surface. This ability develops over time: hatchlings rely on their gills, but adults gulp air and capture the oxygen from it using something called a labyrinth organ, which is attached to the gills and functions similarly to a human lung.",habitat betta fish originated thailand found nearby countries malaysia indonesia vietnam laos cambodia wild bettas live shallow freshwater areas rice paddies stagnant ponds marshes slow moving streams used asian climates prefer warm water around º fahrenheit colder water cause become lethargic stop eating become prone disease infection diet mainly consists plankton crustaceans larvae usual habitats extremely low oxygen bettas evolved breathe air water surface ability develops time hatchlings rely gills adults gulp air capture oxygen using something called labyrinth organ attached gills functions similarly human lung,"['habitat', 'betta', 'fish', 'originated', 'thailand', 'found', 'nearby', 'countries', 'malaysia', 'indonesia', 'vietnam', 'laos', 'cambodia', 'wild', 'bettas', 'live', 'shallow', 'freshwater', 'areas', 'rice', 'paddies', 'stagnant', 'ponds', 'marshes', 'slow', 'moving', 'streams', 'used', 'asian', 'climates', 'prefer', 'warm', 'water', 'around', 'º', 'fahrenheit', 'colder', 'water', 'cause', 'become', 'lethargic', 'stop', 'eating', 'become', 'prone', 'disease', 'infection', 'diet', 'mainly', 'consists', 'plankton', 'crustaceans', 'larvae', 'usual', 'habitats', 'extremely', 'low', 'oxygen', 'bettas', 'evolved', 'breathe', 'air', 'water', 'surface', 'ability', 'develops', 'time', 'hatchlings', 'rely', 'gills', 'adults', 'gulp', 'air', 'capture', 'oxygen', 'using', 'something', 'called', 'labyrinth', 'organ', 'attached', 'gills', 'functions', 'similarly', 'human', 'lung']","[('habitat', 'ORG'), ('thailand', 'GPE'), ('malaysia', 'GPE'), ('indonesia', 'GPE'), ('vietnam', 'GPE'), ('cambodia', 'GPE'), ('bettas', 'GPE'), ('asian', 'NORP'), ('plankton crustaceans', 'ORG'), ('bettas', 'GPE')]"

The 23-carat coin was discovered near Reepham in Norfolk, in 2019. It was declared treasure by a Norfolk coroner.

It was minted at the Tower of London in January 1344, but was only in circulation for seven months before it was withdrawn. There are few survivors.

The site has since been found to contain the ruins of an ancient city made up of residences, sacrificial pits and tombs enclosed by high dirt walls.

However, researchers proposed several possible reasons for these results: They theorised that screen-viewing time displaces physical activities in boys, resulting in more sedentary behaviour. Comparatively, girls were more likely to engage in non-screen-based sedentary behaviour, so the impact of the screen-viewing time may not be as pronounced on the latter. 

“Boys might be naturally or socially encouraged to engage in physical activity when not watching screen devices. In contrast, girls might engage in other sedentary activities more frequently, as reported in a study with older children,” said Ms Natarajan Padmapriya, PhD student and lead author of the study, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore (SSHSPH).
